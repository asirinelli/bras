 Introduction

This software distribution is composed of three distinct programs:

* **BRAS**: An image analysis program that extract the movements of
  the bacteria from digitised movies.

* **Click & Mean**: A signal analysis software which helps the
  interpretation of the movements extracted with *BRAS*.

* **Video Player**: A frame by frame video player.

These software have been written in Python using free software by
`Antoine Sirinelli`_ for the `Oxford Centre for Integrative Systems
Biology`_. They have been used in the following publications:

* **Use of a new motion analysis system to characterize the chemosensory
  response kinetics of Rhodobacter sphaeroides under different growth	
  conditions**, Kojadinovic M., Sirinelli A.,Wadhams G.H., and Armitage
  J.P., *Submitted to AEM*.
